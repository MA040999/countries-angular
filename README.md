## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for some pre-built Tailwind CSS components
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)


### What I learned

- Developing this project, I learnt how to work with CSS Grid and how to make responsive design with CSS Grid.

- I also worked with Angular for the first time in this project and familiarized myself with the workflow of Angular like how to make a network request and how to go about managing data of the application.

- Also, made sure to keep accessibility in mind while developing the project like keyboad navigation and screen reader accessibility.

- Worked with CSS Variables to control the theme colors.
